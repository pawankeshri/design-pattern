Let's assume that we ask the user to provide some of his personal and bank details when he applies for a loan.
Once we receive the details, we might want to validate those. In real life, it might be many more fields and more complex validations.
But, for our simple example, we will take around 10 fields and will perform simple validations â€” like whether the fields are empty.

The number of fields for validation may change over time. We may want to add more fields or may want to temporarily avoid validating certain fields.
Hence, the solution should be flexible enough to adapt to these requirements.

Also, we need two different types of results. The first one is whenever a field is not valid.
We need to return that field without continuing the validations for other remaining fields. The second one is to validate all the fields and return a list of invalid fields.
